RL-Dice
=======

A robust module to roll and manipulate roguelike dice.  This has also been included in [rotLove](https://github.com/paulofmandown/rotLove) roguelike toolkit which I highly recommend if you plan on making a roguelike.

Consult the [online documentation](https://timothymtorres.github.io/RL-Dice) for the API and usage examples.  

The dice module provides the following:

* Dice notation strings - used to create or roll dice instances
* Dice number/faces - can be increased or decreased
* Dice bonus - can be increased or decreased
* Dice rerolls - can reroll and filter out via highest or lowest results 
* Dice sets - can return multiple results
* Dice pluralism - enable bonus or rerolls to individual dice or to all dice
